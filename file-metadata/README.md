# File Metadata Microservice

FreeCodeCamp provides a number of challenges for people to learn web development. This is the solutions I developed for the File Metadata Microservice challenge to learn Back End Development with NodeJS. Here I have all projects implemented in the same server, so it's easier to maintain.

The microservice will return a JSON string containing the size (bytes) of the file uploaded on the request.

**Response Example:**  
`{ "size":175 }`
