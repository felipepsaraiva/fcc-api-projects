# Request Header Parser Microservice

FreeCodeCamp provides a number of challenges for people to learn web development. This is the solutions I developed for the Request Header Parser Microservice challenge to learn Back End Development with NodeJS. Here I have all projects implemented in the same server, so it's easier to maintain.

For every request, the API will return a JSON string containing the request _IP address_, _language_ and _operating system information_.
